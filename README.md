## 🤖 General-Purpose Agent Results

Initial General-Purpose Agent results on ATM-Bench-Hard are summarized below. The QS score here uses `gpt-5-mini` as the primary judge. `Tokens/QS` shows the token cost per point of QS, so lower is more efficient.

| Agent | Model | QS | Total Tokens | Tokens/QS |
|-------|-------|----|--------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | Claude Opus 4.6 | 0.338 | 4.93M | 14.59M |
| Codex | GPT-5.2 | 0.397 | 15.46M | 38.94M |
| Codex | GPT-5.4* | 0.296 | 14.29M | 48.28M |
| OpenCode | GLM-5 | 0.270 | 16.89M | 62.56M |
| OpenCode | Qwen3.5-397B-A17B | 0.245 | 12.06M | 49.16M |
| OpenCode | Kimi K2.5 | 0.303 | 8.46M | 27.92M |
| OpenCode | MiniMax M2.5 | 0.229 | 14.5M | 63.32M |
| OpenCode | MiniMax M2.7 | 0.278 | 13.48M | 48.49M |
| OpenClaw 🦞 | Kimi K2.5 | 0.254 | 9.63M | 37.91M |

* `GPT-5.4` results may be unreliable because the Codex service was unstable during evaluation.

The coding agents still struggle on ATM-Bench-Hard, although they perform much better than various agentic memory baselines.

<a id="overview"></a>
## 📋 Overview

Existing long-term memory benchmarks focus primarily on dialogue history, failing to capture realistic personalized references grounded in lived experience. ATM-Bench addresses this gap with:

- 🖼️ **Multimodal and multi-source data:** Images, videos, emails
- 📅 **Long-term horizon:** ~4 years of personal memory
- 🎯 **Referential queries:** Resolving personalized references (e.g., "Show me the moments where Grace was trying to be sneaky...")
- 🔍 **Evidence-grounded:** Human-annotated QA pairs with ground-truth memory evidence
- 🧩 **Multi-evidence reasoning:** Queries requiring evidence from multiple sources
- ⚡ **Conflicting evidence:** Handling contradictory information

![ATM-Bench Overview](docs/images/ATM-Bench-Demo.png)

<a id="memory-ingestion"></a>
## Memory Ingestion

**Memory Ingestion** is decomposed into:

1. **Memory preprocessing** (how each memory item is represented)
2. **Memory organization** (how items are structured/linked)

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ATM-Method.png" alt="ATM Method" width="50%" />
</p>

### Memory Preprocessing
We compare two preprocessing representations:

- **Descriptive Memory (DM):** each memory item is represented as one natural-language description.
- **Schema-Guided Memory (SGM):** each memory item is represented with fixed text-based key-value fields under a schema.

In SGM, schema fields are modality-aware. For example:

- **Image/Video memory:** `time`, `location`, `entities`, `ocr`, `tags`
- **Email memory:** `time`, `summary`, `body`

DM and SGM contain the same underlying information but use different formats.

In this codebase, DM is implemented as caption/description-style text, while SGM is implemented as schema-based key-value text fields.

### Memory Organization
For organization of the memory store:

- **Piled Memory:** items are stored without explicit links.
- **Linked Memory:** items are linked with inferred relations (graph structure); agentic systems can additionally update existing items during organization.

<a id="niah-evaluation-setup"></a>
## NIAH Evaluation Setup

In addition to end-to-end retrieval + generation evaluation, we provide **NIAH (Needle In A Haystack)**:

- Each question is paired with a fixed evidence pool (`niah_evidence_ids`) that contains all ground-truth items.
- The rest of the pool is filled with realistic distractors.
- This isolates answer generation/reasoning quality from retrieval quality.

See:
- [`docs/niah.md`](docs/niah.md)


<a id="quick-start"></a>
## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
conda create -n atmbench python=3.11 -y
conda activate atmbench
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### API Keys

Set via environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export VLLM_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Or use local key files (gitignored):
- `api_keys/.openai_key`
- `api_keys/.vllm_key`

### Generate Memory Files First

Before running `MMRAG` or `Oracle`, generate the image/video `batch_results.json` files:

```bash
# Optional but recommended: preload reverse-geocoding cache
# Cache files are keyed by media filename stem, so the cache bundle must match
# the current image/video filenames.
bash scripts/memory_processor/image/copy_gps_cache.sh output/image/qwen3vl2b/cache
bash scripts/memory_processor/video/copy_gps_cache.sh output/video/qwen3vl2b/cache

# Generate memory itemization results
bash scripts/memory_processor/image/memory_itemize/run_qwen3vl2b.sh
bash scripts/memory_processor/video/memory_itemize/run_qwen3vl2b.sh
```


### Quick commands (MMRAG + Oracle)

```bash
# MMRAG (runs both ATM-bench and ATM-bench-hard)
bash scripts/QA_Agent/MMRAG/run.sh

# Oracle (upper bound; raw multimodal evidence)
bash scripts/QA_Agent/Oracle/run_oracle_qwen3vl8b_raw.sh

```

### Baseline Compatibility and Environments

- Core baselines (`MMRAG`, `Oracle`, `NIAH`) are tested in the main `atmbench` environment.
- Third-party memory-system baselines in this repo include:
  - `A-Mem`
  - `HippoRAG2`
  - `mem0`
  - `MemoryOS`
- `MemoryOS` is strongly recommended to run in a separate conda environment.
- `A-Mem`, `HippoRAG2`, and `mem0` are tested to be compatible with the core baseline environment, but separate environments are still safer for reproducibility and dependency isolation.
- Setup references for these baselines are under `third_party/`:
  - `third_party/A-mem/`
  - `third_party/HippoRAG/`
  - `third_party/mem0/`
  - `third_party/MemoryOS/`
- OpenClaw support is planned; We will shortly release the evaluation setup for all General-Purpose Agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, OpenClaw) on ATM-Bench.
